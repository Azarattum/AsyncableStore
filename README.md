Lightweight yet powerful asynchronous svelte store. Heavily inspired by [@square/svelte-store](https://github.com/square/svelte-store) and [svelte-asyncable](https://github.com/sveltetools/svelte-asyncable). The goal of this project is to combine all the best features in a simple developer friendly interface.
